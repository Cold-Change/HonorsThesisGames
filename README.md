This repository is dedicated to games produced for the purpose of delving into the process of game development.
All games are produced in Godot version 4.2.2.
To view and play the games in this repository, simply download the repo and unzip "Godot_v4.2.2-stable_win64.exe".
To view each project, either right click (or double click) on the "project.godot" file in the respective game folder and open with the unzipped "Godot_v4.2.2-stable_win64.exe".
Alternatively, you can directly open the "Godot_v4.2.2-stable_win64.exe" file and navigate to the project through there by selecting "Import" in the top left corner.
